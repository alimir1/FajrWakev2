![Fajr Wake: Islamic Alarm Clock app for Fajr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimir1/FajrWakev2/master/fajrWakeBanner.png)

An Islamic iOS alarm clock app that helps Muslims wake up early morning. It lets you wake up at Fajr, 30 mins before sunrise, 5 mins before Fajr, or whenever you choose to wake up. Fajr Wake updates calculations for Fajr and Sunrise time daily so you don't need to reset alarm or check timing.

## About the app

Islam requires that Muslims pray 5 times a day. These prayers (i.e. Salah) cannot be prayed just at any times. They must be prayed on specific times. The following is a list of 5 obligatory daily prayers with corresponding timing for that prayer:

* **Fajr**: When the sky begins to lighten (dawn).
* **Dhuhr**: When the Sun begins to decline after reaching its highest point in the sky.
* **Asr**: The time when the length of any object's shadow reaches a factor (usually 1 or 2) of the length of the object itself plus the length of that object's shadow at noon.
* **Maghreb**: Soon after sunset.
* **Isha**: The time at which darkness falls and there is no scattered light in the sky.

Fajr prayer begins when the sky begins to lighten and ends at sunrise. (**Note: This is a simplified version of the ruling for non-Muslims to better understand. Please note that there are different opinions amongst Islamic scholars.**).

You can learn more about Islamic prayer times [here](http://praytimes.org/wiki/Prayer_Times_Calculation).

There are many great Islamic prayer time alarm clock apps available at the app store. We created this app because:

* It lets users set appropriate alarm timing based on their needs. For example: at Fajr, 30 min before sunrise, 15 min before Fajr, etc.
* Alarm times are autmocally updated daily (as Fajr and Sunrise timing change every day) so that users don't need to calculate and keep track of wake up time daily.
